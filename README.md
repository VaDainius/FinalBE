# FinalBE
This is back-end part of final project

Project theme is Helmet shop.
Main idea behind is that it is a e-shop of both used and new ALL type of helmets.

In this back-end part there are entities, controllers and repositories which communicate with the not-in memory working MySQL database. 
Docker container was used for Database connection. 
For Database management - HeidiSQL.

Back-end part has no security, no available endpoints to use as a standalone.
